/**
 * Solution to a challenge
 * 'CodeSignal, Arcade, Intro, 5. shapeArea'.
 *
 * Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area
 * of a polygon for a given n.
 *
 * A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An
 * n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and
 * appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the
 * 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

 *
 * @returns {number}
 * Integer. The area of the n-interesting polygon.
