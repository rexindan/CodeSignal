/**
 * Solution to a challenge
 * 'CodeSignal, Company Challenges, Quora, questionCorrectionBot'.
 *
 * When a user asks a question on Quora, the system automatically tries to
 * improve the question's formatting before showing it to more users. Given a
 * question as an input string, perform formatting corrections according to the
 * following rules:
 * - Strip excessive whitespaces:
 *   - Remove whitespaces at the start and end, as well as multiple spaces in a
 *     row
 * - Fix spacing around punctuation:
 *   - Each comma should have a trailing space, but no space preceding it
 * - Questions should start with a capital letter
 * - Questions should end with a single question mark (not 0 or more than one).
 *
 * @param {string} question
 * It is guaranteed that the input string contains at least one non-whitespace
 * character, and the first of these characters is a letter (possibly
 * lowercase).
 * Guaranteed constraints: question.length ≤ 100.
 *
 * @returns {string}
 * Corrected version of the question.
